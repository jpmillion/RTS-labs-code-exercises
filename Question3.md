If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

Presently, javascript is my favorite language.  If I could change 1 thing about javascript it would be the ambigutity of the this keyword in functions.  I do not like having to explicitly bind this to ensure an expected outcome.  I think it should adhere to lexical scope rather than depend on the call site of the function.  Also, I would like the name of the keyword changed from this to self.
